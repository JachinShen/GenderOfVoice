\section{Application}
I deploy a web service to recongize the uploaded voice. I choose Python as the main language to implement it. After searching, I use Flask\cite{flask} as the framework, use rpy2\cite{rpy2} to extract features from raw voice by R packages.

The source code is in folder web. To deploy it, I search and solve the following problems.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How to upload file using flask \cite{upload_file}
    \item The returned values of fund \cite{r_fund}
    \item How to scale on reduced feature \cite{scale_feature}
    \item How to convert voice in to 'wav' type using ffmpeg \cite{ffmpeg_convert}
    \item The beautiful html template \cite{html_template}
    \item How to change css in flask \cite{css_flask}
    \item How to customize upload button \cite{upload_button}
    \item How to deploy flask with gunicorn and nginx \cite{flask_deploy}
\end{enumerate}

The web service is deployed on \url{http://qasd.tk:4040}
